# stock-analysis
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to refactor the original code to collect all stocks in 2017 and 2018 to determine if these stocks will be profitable to invest in. The goal for this round was to increase the efficiency and respond time of the original code.
### Background
The data that is presented includes two charts with stock information on 12 different stocks. At the click of a button, Stev can analyze an entire dataset. Now, to do a little more research for his parents, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Our code works well for a dozen stocks, but it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, it may take a long time to execute. The stock information we refractored below contains a ticker value, the date the stock was issued, the opening, closing and adjusted closing price, the highest and lowest price, and the volume of the stock. The goal is to retrieve the ticker, the total daily volume, and the return on each stock.

The images shown above shows the analysis for stocks in 2018. The analysis for 2018 shows that tickers "RUN" and "ENPH" were the only tickers that had a positive return for 2018.
